If you've got local source code you want to add to a new remote new git repository without 'cloning' the remote first, do the following (I often do this - you create your remote empty repository in bitbucket/github, then push up your source)

1 Create the remote repository, and get the URL such as git@github.com:/youruser/somename.git or https://github.com/youruser/somename.git
If your local GIT repo is already set up, skips steps 2 and 3

2 Locally, at the root directory of your source, git init
2a. If you initialize the repo with a .gitignore and a README.md you should do a git pull {url from step 1} to ensure you don't commit files to source that you want to ignore ;)

3 Locally, add and commit what you want in your initial repo (for everything, git add . then  git commit -m 'initial commit comment')

4 to attach your remote repo with the name 'origin' (like cloning would do)
git remote add origin [URL From Step 1]

5 Execute git pull origin master to pull the remote branch so that they are in sync.
6 to push up your master branch (change master to something else for a different branch):
git push origin master"# TI" 
"# TI" 
"# TI"
